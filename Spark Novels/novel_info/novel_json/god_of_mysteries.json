      "content": "The world was ending, though most people didn’t realize it yet.\n\nThe sky had lost its color. The streets were empty, as if the city itself was holding its breath. Somewhere far away, a bell rang, deep and hollow, echoing through the silence.\n\nI stood there, hands in my pockets, staring at the horizon. The buildings stretched like shadows, and for a moment it felt like I was the only one left.\n\nA faint light flickered in front of me — a single page, floating in the air. Letters burned themselves across it, glowing in the darkness.\n\n> [Welcome, Player.]\n\nAt first, I thought it was a trick. Maybe a broken sign, maybe my mind playing games with me. But then another line appeared beneath it.\n\n> [Your story begins now.]\n\nI reached out without thinking. The page dissolved into sparks, scattering like fireflies into my skin. My heart skipped a beat, and suddenly the silence around me wasn’t empty anymore. It was heavy. Alive.\n\nThe wind shifted. From the corner of the street, shadows began to crawl, stretching longer than they should. A whisper, faint and cold, brushed against my ear.\n\nI didn’t move. I couldn’t. All I could do was watch as the world I thought I knew twisted into something unfamiliar.\n\nAnd then, in the middle of that silence, a figure appeared. A man dressed in old clothes, with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes.\n\nHe tipped his hat toward me. “The Fool has entered the stage,” he said softly.\n\nAnd just like that, the world fell apart."

      "content": "When I opened my eyes, the city was gone.\n\nThe cracked streets, the empty buildings, the gray sky — all of it had dissolved like smoke. In its place was a vast hall, lit by torches that burned without fire. The ceiling stretched into darkness, too high for me to see. The floor beneath my feet wasn’t stone or wood. It was glass. Clear, flawless glass, and below it… nothing. An endless drop into emptiness.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat.\n\nDozens of pages drifted lazily in the air above me, glowing faintly as they circled like birds. Each one carried words, but the letters were blurred, shifting too quickly to read.\n\nA voice echoed through the hall. The same calm, amused voice from before.\n\n> “Every story begins with a choice.”\n\nThe words rippled through the air, shaking the pages. Slowly, they began to fall. One by one, they drifted toward me, landing softly at my feet.\n\nI crouched down and picked one up.\n\nThe letters sharpened the moment my fingers touched it.\n\n> [Trait Acquired: The Fool]\n\nI stared at the page, unsure if I should laugh or panic. “The Fool?” What was that supposed to mean?\n\nBefore I could question further, the page dissolved into sparks, the same way the first had. Heat rushed through my body, sinking into my chest, leaving behind a dull ache.\n\nThen the voice spoke again.\n\n> “Do not fear. Every beginning seems foolish.”\n\nI spun around.\n\nThe man in the hat stood at the far end of the hall. His clothes looked older now, worn and frayed, though his smile hadn’t changed. He walked slowly, each step echoing against the glass floor.\n\n“Who are you?” I asked, though my voice came out weaker than I wanted.\n\nHe tilted his head, as though the question amused him. “A guide. An actor. A witness. Call me whatever you like.”\n\nI swallowed hard. “And me?”\n\nHe stopped, only a few paces away. His eyes, sharp and unreadable, met mine.\n\n“You,” he said, “are the Fool who dared to step on stage.”\n\nThe torches flared. The floor beneath me shook. From the glass below, shadows surged upward, twisting into shapes. Arms, legs, bodies without faces — dozens of them, crawling toward me.\n\nThe man tipped his hat once more.\n\n> “Now, let the story begin.”"

      "content": "The shadows lunged before I could breathe. Their forms were vague, like smoke clinging to the shape of men, but their presence was solid enough to make the floor tremble. I stepped back, and the glass beneath my feet pulsed with faint blue light.\n\nInstinct screamed at me to run—but where? There were no doors, no walls, only endless glass fading into darkness.\n\nI clenched my fists. My pulse was loud in my ears. Then, without warning, the voice returned, calm and almost curious.\n\n> [Skill Activated: Fool’s Insight]\n\nThe words flashed in the air before me, bright and cold. My body moved on its own—ducking, sidestepping, avoiding the nearest shadow’s strike as if I’d seen it coming a second before it happened.\n\nI didn’t understand how, but my mind was clear. Each motion felt deliberate, guided by something unseen.\n\nThe man in the hat stood where he’d been, watching silently. The torchlight bent around him as if even the fire was afraid to touch him.\n\n‘Why are you just watching?!’ I wanted to shout, but the moment I looked away, one of the shadows leapt. I threw out my hand on reflex—and something answered.\n\nLight burst from my palm, sharp and white. The shadow shrieked as it melted away into smoke, its voice echoing like wind in an empty room.\n\nI froze, staring at my hand. The glow faded, leaving nothing behind but trembling fingers.\n\n‘What… was that?’\n\nThe man smiled faintly. “A Fool, perhaps. Or maybe something more.”\n\nBefore I could respond, the remaining shadows sank back into the glass, vanishing one by one. The hall quieted, as if the world itself was waiting for the next act.\n\nThe man tipped his hat again. “You’ve survived your first step, Fool. The stage is yours.”\n\nThe torches dimmed, and the floor beneath me began to shift. A pattern appeared—circles upon circles, glowing faintly with gold symbols.\n\nThen everything fell away."

      "content": "The fall didn’t end. It felt like sinking through time itself, the world twisting around me until light and shadow blurred into one. My thoughts scattered like dust. When I finally hit the ground, it wasn’t pain that greeted me—it was silence.\n\nI was standing in a forest.\n\nMist rolled between the trees, pale and soft. The air smelled of rain, though the sky above was black and starless. For a moment, I wondered if I was still falling, if the world beneath my feet was even real.\n\nI looked down. The symbols from before had followed me, faintly glowing on the back of my right hand. They pulsed once, then faded.\n\n> [Welcome to the First Layer: The Veiled Garden]\n\nThe voice was gone, replaced by words that simply appeared in front of me like before. My head spun. A world that wasn’t my own, skills that came from nowhere, and a name—‘The Fool’—that didn’t belong to me.\n\n“What kind of dream is this…” I whispered.\n\nThe sound of movement snapped my attention forward. Something rustled in the mist. I squinted, trying to make out a shape. It was small at first, hunched, dragging its limbs through the fog.\n\nA child? No. Too long. Too thin.\n\nThen I saw its face—or what should’ve been one. Hollow eyes, carved deep into smooth skin, no mouth, no nose. It turned toward me and began to crawl faster.\n\nMy heart jumped into my throat. I backed away, tripping over a root and hitting the ground hard. The creature lunged, and before I could think, my hand glowed again.\n\nA burst of light shot forward, pure and bright. The creature screamed without a mouth and vanished into mist.\n\nMy breathing was ragged, my chest burning. The forest quieted once more.\n\nFrom behind me, a familiar voice spoke. “The Fool acts without thought, yet survives through chance. How fitting.”\n\nI turned. The man in the hat leaned against a tree, shadows curling around his coat.\n\n“What do you want from me?” I asked, my voice shaking.\n\nHe smiled again, calm and distant. “To see if you’ll play your part well.”\n\nI wanted to shout at him, but before I could, the mist thickened, swallowing him whole. Only his words remained.\n\n> “Every Fool must face the truth they deny.”\n\nAnd once again, I was alone."

      "content": "The forest was quiet after the man vanished, but the silence didn’t comfort me. It pressed against my chest, heavy and alive. I kept walking through the mist, trying to find anything—an exit, a voice, even another shadow. But the world seemed endless, looping like a dream I couldn’t wake from.\n\nAfter a while, I saw a faint light between the trees. A lantern. My heart leapt. Someone was there.\n\nI approached slowly, each step cautious. The mist parted just enough to reveal an old man sitting beside a stone table. His face was hidden under a hood, but his hands were steady as he poured tea into two cups.\n\n“You took your time,” he said, not looking up.\n\n“Do I... know you?”\n\n“In a way,” he said, sliding one cup toward me. “All Fools meet their Mirror.”\n\nI didn’t understand what he meant, but I sat anyway. The tea smelled faintly of herbs and smoke. When I lifted it, my reflection in the cup didn’t match my face. The eyes staring back were sharp, distant, and older than mine.\n\n“What is this place?” I asked.\n\n“The First Layer,” he said simply. “A test of truth. You walk it until you remember who you were.”\n\nI frowned. “And if I don’t?”\n\nHe smiled, thin and knowing. “Then you’ll keep walking until the forest forgets you too.”\n\nBefore I could reply, the lantern flickered. The mist thickened, curling around the table. The old man and the light faded, leaving me alone again.\n\nIn the distance, I heard footsteps—not mine this time. Something else was moving in the fog, slow and deliberate.\n\nI took a breath and followed the sound."

      "content": "The footsteps led me deeper into the forest. The fog was thinner here, and I began to see faint ruins—pillars cracked by time, broken stone paths covered in moss. The air was cold, but it carried a faint hum, like distant voices whispering through glass.\n\nThen I saw her.\n\nA woman stood near the ruins, facing away from me. Long dark hair flowed down her back, and her clothes were torn, but she stood perfectly still, as if waiting. My chest tightened. I knew that silhouette. I had seen it before—back in the real world.\n\nI called out before I could stop myself. “...Mira?”\n\nShe turned slowly. For a heartbeat, it really was her. The same soft eyes, the same faint smile I’d thought I’d lost.\n\nBut then her smile cracked. The skin around her mouth split, and her eyes turned hollow.\n\n“Mira” stepped toward me, her voice layered and wrong. “You shouldn’t be here.”\n\nThe ground trembled. Shadows crawled from beneath the ruins, drawn toward her. I backed away, heart pounding, but the familiar glow sparked in my hand again. Light flared, pushing the darkness back.\n\n“Mira,” I whispered, my voice shaking. “If this isn’t you… what are you?”\n\nShe smiled wider, too wide. “Your memory,” she said softly. “And your mistake.”\n\nThe forest roared. The shadows surged again, swallowing the ruins, and I was forced to fight. The light from my hand burned brighter with every strike, until everything went white.\n\nWhen the world cleared, she was gone.\n\nOnly her voice lingered, faint and distant. “Find the truth, Fool… before it finds you.”"

      "content": "Long ago, the world was alive with light.\n\nCities floated upon rivers of mana, and even the wind hummed with spellcraft. But that age ended in fire — the Arcane Collapse. Magic became forbidden, sealed by kings and scholars who feared its return.\n\nCenturies later, few remembered the old songs. Spells turned to myths, and myths to bedtime stories.\n\nYet beneath the quiet soil of a forgotten valley, a single ember still burned.\n\nIt waited — patient, dreaming of the day it would wake once more."

      "title": "Chapter 1 — The Boy Who Dreamed of Light",
      "content": "The village of Dalen was small enough that the sun could rise and set before anyone noticed the difference.\n\nErynd lived at the edge of it — a boy of eighteen winters with a mind too curious for his own good. While others farmed or fished, he spent his days buried in the archives of the old chapel, tracing the faded ink of forgotten manuscripts.\n\nHe didn’t believe in the gods, but he believed in what came before them.\n\nMagic.\n\n“Old stories,” the priest would say whenever Erynd asked too many questions. “The world doesn’t need it anymore.”\n\nBut Erynd couldn’t shake the dreams. Every night, he saw flames of blue and silver — runes spiraling like stars, a whisper calling his name.\n\nWhen he awoke, his hands always felt warm."

      "title": "Chapter 2 — Whispers Beneath the Chapel",
      "content": "Rain fell softly the night Erynd found the sealed door.\n\nHe had been cataloguing relics in the lower vaults when the floor trembled — just enough to dislodge a slab of stone. Beneath it, a narrow passage led into darkness, lined with walls carved in runes too faint to read.\n\nCuriosity won.\n\nTorch in hand, he descended the steps, his shadow dancing across symbols that pulsed faintly with light. At the end of the hall stood a single pedestal, upon which rested a sphere no larger than his palm — glowing softly, like a heart that refused to die.\n\nHe reached for it.\n\nThe light flared, searing through his veins.\n\nAnd the whisper from his dreams spoke aloud for the first time.\n\n> “You’ve found me.”"

      "title": "Chapter 3 — The Spark Within",
      "content": "The pain came first — fire and frost colliding in his blood. Erynd collapsed, clutching his chest as light poured from his skin. The vault shook. Dust rained from above.\n\nWhen the glow faded, he lay gasping on the cold floor. The sphere was gone. In its place, a mark burned on his palm — a spiral of light that pulsed like a heartbeat.\n\n> [Arcane Core Assimilated.]\n\nHe didn’t understand the words. They weren’t written, yet he heard them as clearly as his own thoughts.\n\nWhen he tried to move, sparks followed his fingertips.\n\nMagic.\n\nReal, living magic.\n\nHe should’ve been terrified. Instead, he smiled."

      "title": "Chapter 4 — Secrets of the Old World",
      "content": "For days, Erynd hid his discovery. He tested the limits of his newfound power in secret — lighting candles with a thought, moving dust in the air, shaping water with his breath.\n\nBut every use came with exhaustion. The mark on his hand dimmed when he slept, as if consuming his strength to remain lit.\n\nIn the archives, he searched for answers. Most texts had been censored centuries ago, but in one forgotten tome, he found a single phrase beneath the seal of the old Magisters:\n\n> *The Arcane Core chooses its vessel.*\n\nThe words sent a chill through him. He wasn’t the first — but if the records were right, he might be the last."

      "content": "The peace of Dalen didn’t last.\n\nOne morning, riders arrived — cloaked figures bearing the silver sigil of the Inquisition. They claimed to be investigating heresy, but everyone knew what that meant: someone had used forbidden magic.\n\nErynd watched from the crowd as they questioned the priest. His mark burned faintly beneath his glove, reacting to their presence.\n\nThe leader, a woman with eyes like tempered steel, looked toward him for just a moment — and in that glance, he felt the weight of centuries of fear.\n\n“Magic is a curse,” she said to the gathered villagers. “And curses spread when left unchecked.”\n\nThat night, Erynd began packing his things."

      "content": "He left before dawn.\n\nThe forest beyond Dalen was thick with fog, the kind that swallowed sound and breath alike. Each step took him farther from the life he’d known, and deeper into the unknown.\n\nThe mark on his hand guided him — glowing faintly whenever he faced north. Once, he thought he heard voices whispering in the dark. When he turned, only the trees remained.\n\nBy the third night, the forest came alive.\n\nFigures of ash and shadow emerged from the mist — remnants of spells long dead, drawn to the power inside him. He ran, but they followed, silent and endless.\n\nWhen he finally collapsed, a burst of light erupted from his palm, scattering them like dust.\n\nAnd in that light, a figure waited — cloaked in blue, smiling faintly.\n\n> “Took you long enough to wake.”"

      "content": "Her name was Lyra — a wanderer, or so she claimed. But Erynd recognized the runes woven into her cloak. They belonged to the old Magisters, the order that once ruled over magic itself.\n\nShe told him the truth: magic had not died. It had been buried, sealed by those who feared its power. The Arcane Core he carried was one of seven — remnants of the world’s primal forces.\n\n“The one you bear,” she said, “is the Core of Awakening. It doesn’t grant power. It restores it.”\n\nShe offered to teach him, to guide him to the ruins of the old citadel where the other Cores might still sleep.\n\nErynd hesitated.\n\nBut when the wind whispered his name again, he followed."

      "title": "Chapter 8 — Lessons in Light and Shadow",
      "content": "Magic was not learned. It was remembered.\n\nThat was Lyra’s first lesson.\n\nEach spell was a song, and each word a memory older than language itself. Under her guidance, Erynd learned to listen — to feel the pulse of the world, to draw energy not from strength but from balance.\n\nSome nights, they camped under the stars. Others, they hid from the Inquisitors still hunting them. The bond between them grew — mentor and student, bound by the same forbidden fire.\n\nBut with each new spell, Erynd felt the Core inside him change — hungrier, restless, as if something ancient was waking inside his soul."

      "content": "They reached the ruins at the edge of the world.\n\nStone towers half-swallowed by earth, sigils glowing faintly under moonlight. The air trembled with forgotten power. At the center stood an altar — cracked but still pulsing faintly with light.\n\nLyra placed a hand on his shoulder. “Whatever happens next, don’t resist it.”\n\nErynd stepped forward. The mark on his hand blazed like fire. The world spun, the sky turned white, and he felt something vast awaken inside him.\n\n> [Arcane Core — Fully Awakened.]\n\nVisions flooded his mind — of ancient wars, gods burning, oceans turning to glass. He saw the fall of magic, and the reason it was sealed.\n\nWhen the light faded, he stood alone.\n\nThe Core was silent.\n\nBut in his reflection, his eyes glowed like molten gold."
